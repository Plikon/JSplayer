"# JSplayer" 
Just bunch of pre-writen functions for customizable HTML5 audio player. Also, it allows requesting JSON file with list of songs from client side, so you can swich media elements (JS script changing HTML media element src atribute)

All you have to do is to make media element and "inicialize" player 
 example:
 <html>
  <body>
  <audio id="track" src="" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>
    <script>
      var player = document.getElementById('track');			
		</script>
    </body?
    </html>

I'm planning to automatize adding songs, so you don't have to do json file by yourself, but that's music of future.
